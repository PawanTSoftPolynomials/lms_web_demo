/**
 * Publication preconditions for Module / Lesson / Topic.
 *
 * The original rule was "a Module needs a Lesson, a Lesson needs a Topic, a
 * Topic needs a Content" — written when Content could only hang off a Topic.
 * The course model now attaches Content, Quiz and Assignment directly at all
 * four levels, so a Module whose entire body is a direct Content (or a Quiz,
 * or an Assignment) satisfied none of those rules and could never be published
 * — leaving it permanently invisible to students with no way to fix it from
 * the UI.
 *
 * The guard itself is still worth keeping: publishing a genuinely empty node
 * shows students a dead end. So the rule becomes "has at least one child of
 * ANY publishable kind" rather than "has at least one child of one specific
 * kind".
