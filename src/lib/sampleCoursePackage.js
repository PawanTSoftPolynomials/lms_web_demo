/**
 * Builds the downloadable sample course package.
 *
 * This is a *physical* course package: the Course -> Modules -> Lessons ->
 * Topics hierarchy exists as real folders in the ZIP, and each artifact is a
 * real file in the folder that gives it its meaning. There is deliberately no
 * course.json — an instructor who extracts this ZIP should be able to read the
 * shape of a course straight off the directory tree.
 *
 * Artifact formats follow what the LMS already reads:
 *   Quiz       -> .csv  (the question columns from ImportQuestionsModal,
 *                        prefixed with the quiz's own settings)
 *   Assignment -> .md   (YAML frontmatter + brief)
 *   Content    -> .md   (YAML frontmatter + body) alongside real media files
 *
 * Sample subject matches the C Programming Fundamentals data already used by
 * the import page's template.
