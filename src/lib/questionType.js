// The API/DB QuestionType enum (prisma/schema.prisma) has two synonym pairs
// the quiz UI doesn't know: "MCQ" for a single-choice question and
// "MULTIPLE_CORRECT" for a multi-choice one. Everywhere the UI branches on a
// question's type (QuestionCard, QuestionReviewCard, QuizExperience) and
// wherever quizAnswers.js grades an answer, it needs the UI's own keys
// (MCQ_SINGLE/MCQ_MULTI/...), not the raw API value — this is the one place
// that translation happens, so every consumer stays in agreement.
//
// ARRANGE_TOKENS and MATCH_PAIRS already match the UI's keys and pass
// through unchanged. TRUE_FALSE/FILL_BLANK/SHORT_ANSWER/LONG_ANSWER have no
// dedicated UI or grading branch yet (see QuestionCard.jsx/quizAnswers.js) —
// they pass through as-is rather than being silently coerced to the wrong
// type; adding real support for them is separate, future work.
