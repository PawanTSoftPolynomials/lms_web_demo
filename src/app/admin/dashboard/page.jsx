/**
 * Admin Home.
 *
 * An admin's remit on this platform is narrow and specific (see CLAUDE.md §8):
 * they review courses, publish / unpublish / archive them, and set pricing.
 * Instructors are explicitly forbidden from all of that. So the queue of
 * courses waiting on an admin decision is the page, and it leads.
 *
 * Ordered as: who you are and what today holds -> the four platform numbers,
 * each linking somewhere -> what is waiting on a decision -> today's movement,
 * who just signed up, what just happened -> how courses are performing.
 *
 * Deliberately absent:
 *  - The published-vs-draft donut. Two categories is not a chart, and both
 *    numbers are already stated elsewhere on the page.
 *  - "Top performing instructor". A leaderboard of exactly one person, ranked
 *    by raw enrollment count — which rewards whoever owns the biggest course
 *    rather than measuring performance. The Instructors screen ranks properly.
 *  - The upcoming-events panel, which duplicated /admin/calendar.
 * Those components are still in the tree if the product wants them back.
